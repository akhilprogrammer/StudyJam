  Asynchronous programming is a way to run multiple tasks (functions) parallely with our main program 

  we create 'asynchronous functions' for implemnting asynchronous programming in our code
  
  so these functions can run parallely with our main program

  so what is asynchronous functions ? how it is different from normal functions ? lets we check

  in our normal programming 

    if we call a function from our main program 

    then main program waits for completing function execution

    so we can only run next line of our main program after function execution completed


  but in asynchronous programming

    if we call a asynchronous function from our main program

    function run as a seperate task

    so we dont need to wait for completing of function execution-

    to run next line of code of our main program 


  these parallel execution help us mainly for performing more time consuming tasks like http request, i/o operation etc..
