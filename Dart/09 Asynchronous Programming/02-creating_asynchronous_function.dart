  we can create asynchronous functions in 2 way

    1) A function which returns a Future

    2) A function which returnes a Stream         (we can explore each concepts deeply in our next lessons)



  for creating a asynchronous function we mark a function as async or async*

*/

// we created a asynchronous function which retun a Future

Future getData() async{
  
}

// we created a asynchronous function which return a Stream 

Stream getMessage() async* {

}
