// a class is a blue print (model)
// also we can say that a class is a user defined data type
// a class contain 3 members - variables, constructor and methods
// we can create a new instance(copy) of a class and save into a object(just a variable)



void main() {

  var myCar1 = Car();   // here we created a new instance (copy) of class Car and save into object mycar1

  var myCar2 = Car();   // here we created another instance (copy) of class Car and save into object mycar2


  // we can create any number of instance of a class. each are independent to others

}


// here we create a class named Car 

class Car {

}
