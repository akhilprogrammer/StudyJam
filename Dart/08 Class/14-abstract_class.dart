/*
    A class which is declared as abstract is known as an abstract class
    abstract class contain abstract and non-abstract methods, variables ...
    abstract class canâ€™t be instantiated.
    abstract methods of a abstract classes are implement in the extended class
    abstract classes mainly use to create interfaces in dart

    for easy understand we can say as, we declare a structure of class
    but its implementation take place in extended class

    lets we check an example , we create a structure of vechicle with 3 abstract method
    here we create a common structure for a vechicle but all its implementation is in extended class
